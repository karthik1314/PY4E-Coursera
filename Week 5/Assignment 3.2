#Write a program to prompt for a score between 0.0 and 1.0. If the score is out of range, print an error. If the score is between 0.0 and 1.0, print a grade using the following table:
Score Grade
>= 0.9 A
>= 0.8 B
>= 0.7 C
>= 0.6 D
< 0.6 F
If the user enters a value out of range, print a suitable error message and exit. For the test, enter a score of 0.85.

Python Code: 

s = float(input("Enter a score: "))
if 0.0 <= s <= 1.0:
    if s >= 0.9:
        result = "A"
        print(result)
    elif 0.8 <= s <= 0.9
         result = "B"
         print(result)
    elif 0.7 <= s <= 0.8
         result = "C"
         print(result)
    elif 0.6 <= s <= 0.5
        result = "D"
        print(result)
else:
    print("Error: Score is out of range")
